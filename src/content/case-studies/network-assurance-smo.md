### Problem
The integration of O-CU/O-DU components within an evolving O-RAN environment suffered from a lack of centralized visibility and significant discrepancies in the classification of performance KPIs.

### Solution
Aligned all assurance workflows with **O-RAN** and **3GPP** standards, integrating **CM (Configuration Management)**, **PM (Performance Management)**, and **FM (Fault Management)** interfaces to establish a single pane of glass for centralized observability via the **Capgemini SMO**.

### Result
Resolved over **1,200 KPI inconsistencies** and achieved **100% compliance** in parameter configuration standards, ensuring a robust and observable network foundation for future automation.
