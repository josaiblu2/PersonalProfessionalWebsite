### Problem
Inconsistencies in the activation of automated features across different equipment manufacturers (**Samsung, Nokia, Ericsson**) within the **Verizon** network led to configuration drift and operational instability.

### Solution
Designed and implemented a **First Feature Application (FFA)** strategy with strict 'readiness gates' to validate critical cSON functions such as **ANR (Automatic Neighbor Relation)**, **DPO (Dynamic Parameter Optimization)**, and **PCI Management** before network-wide deployment.

### Result
Achieved **National Unified Governance** and mitigated instability risks prior to the mass deployment of the **VFBO (Voice Fall Back Optimization)** application.
