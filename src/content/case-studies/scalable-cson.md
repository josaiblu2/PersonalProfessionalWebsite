### Problem
Manual optimization processes were distinctively slow and difficult to scale effectively for Tier-1 networks without compromising overall network integrity and performance.

### Solution
Implemented advanced optimization logic for **LTE and 5G RAN**, balancing coverage, capacity, and interference through automated decisions driven by real-time KPIs. This included proactive **software validation** mechanisms to prevent regression during updates.

### Result
Delivered a **55% improvement in operational visibility** and successfully prevented network incidents through proactive software validation and automated incident detection logic.
