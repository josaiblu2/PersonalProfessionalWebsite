# Network Slicing: The Ultimate Test for Closed-Loop Automation

Network Slicing is the "Holy Grail" of 5G. The ability to run multiple virtual networks with different performance characteristics on a single physical infrastructure. But for Network Slicing to move from a marketing concept to a commercial reality, it requires something most networks still struggle with: **True, real-time, closed-loop automation.** Network Slicing is the ultimate test for SON and automation for three main reasons:

1. **Dynamic Resource Orchestration:** Slices are not static. They must be created, scaled, and terminated based on real-time demand. If a slice for "Remote Surgery" needs guaranteed low latency, the network must be able to reallocate resources instantly without affecting other slices. 
2. **SLA Assurance:** In a sliced world, KPIs are replaced by SLAs (Service Level Agreements). Automation must be able to monitor performance at the slice level and take corrective actions *before* the SLA is breached. 
3. **Cross-Domain Coordination:** A slice is not just a RAN feature. It spans the Core, Transport, and RAN. Automation must be coordinated across all these domains to ensure end-to-end performance. 

This is where traditional, siloed SON fails. We need a **Service Management and Orchestration (SMO)** layer that can act as the "brain" of the network, coordinating automation across domains and vendors. 

Without closed-loop automation, Network Slicing is just a manual configuration nightmare. With it, it becomes the foundation for the next generation of digital services.
