# From Coverage KPIs to Revenue KPIs: The Missing Link in 5G Strategy

For decades, RAN success was measured in technical excellence.

* RSRP improved.
* SINR stabilized.
* Throughput increased.
* Coverage expanded.

And as engineers, we took pride in those achievements.
But here is the uncomfortable reality:
Boards do not approve investments based on RSRP.
Investors do not reward SINR.
Shareholders do not celebrate PCI optimization.
They look at revenue growth, ARPU, churn, EBITDA.
Somewhere between Coverage KPIs and Revenue KPIs, we lost alignment.
5G strategy in many operators still follows a traditional pattern:

* •	Network teams optimize performance indicators in isolation.
* •	Marketing teams design commercial offers afterward.
* •	Finance evaluates results months later.

This sequential model no longer works in a capital-intensive 5G era.
Because high coverage does not automatically mean high monetization.
The missing link is translation.
Translation between:

* •	Network performance and customer experience.
* •	Customer experience and willingness to pay.
* •	Willingness to pay and measurable revenue impact.

For example, improving latency by 5 milliseconds is technically impressive.
But what service does that enable?
What segment values it?
What premium does it justify?
If we cannot answer those questions, the KPI remains operational, not strategic.
The shift we need is simple in concept, complex in execution:
From optimizing networks for coverage
To designing networks for revenue enablement.
That means:

* •	Defining performance targets based on service differentiation, not just generic benchmarks.
* •	Aligning RAN planning with specific monetizable use cases.
* •	Using automation and analytics to identify where performance improvement directly influences churn or upsell potential.

5G will not fail because of poor radio engineering.
It will underperform if engineering and business strategy remain disconnected.
The real competitive advantage is not who has the widest coverage map.
It is who can clearly demonstrate how network performance translates into financial performance.
Coverage is the foundation.
Revenue is the objective.
Bridging them is leadership.
