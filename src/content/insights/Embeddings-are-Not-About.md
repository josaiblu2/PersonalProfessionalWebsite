# Embeddings are not about search, they’re about how AI sees knowledge

Embeddings are often oversimplified as a search technique. In reality, they are about **defining how AI represents reality**.

When we create embeddings, we project knowledge into a mathematical space where distance and direction carry meaning. In that space, ideas are "close" because they are **conceptually related**, not just because they share keywords.

### Why Embeddings are a Core Architectural Decision:
* **Visibility:** They define which relationships the model can "see".
* **Assumptions:** They encode our definitions of meaning and relevance.
* **Reasoning:** They influence whether AI uses shallow resemblance or deep conceptual similarity.

In RAG systems, this becomes critical. Retrieval quality is not limited by the vector database or the search algorithm. It is limited by how knowledge was embedded in the first place.
If embeddings are poorly designed, the system retrieves noise with confidence.
If embeddings are well designed, the system retrieves insight with restraint.

This is why two RAG systems with the same documents and the same LLM can behave completely differently. They are not seeing the same knowledge. They are seeing different representations of it.

Search is just the surface behavior.
Embeddings are the perception layer.

And like any perception system, what AI can understand is bounded by how we choose to represent the world.

That is why embeddings are not an implementation detail.
They are how AI learns to see.
