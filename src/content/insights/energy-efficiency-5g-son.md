# Energy Efficiency: The New Frontier for SON in 5G

In previous generations, SON was primarily measured by throughput and drop rates. In 5G, a new KPI has taken center stage: **Energy Efficiency**. With the massive increase in site density and MIMO complexity, managing power consumption is no longer optional—it is a business and environmental necessity.

SON is uniquely positioned to drive energy savings through:
• **Symbol/Cell Shutdown:** Intelligent sleep modes that react to real-time traffic demand without impacting user experience.
• **Massive MIMO Power Scaling:** Adjusting active antenna elements based on load.
• **Multi-Layer Traffic Steering:** Moving traffic to the most energy-efficient layer (e.g., from a high-power macro to a small cell) when appropriate.

The challenge is the **trade-off**. Aggressive power saving can impact latency and accessibility. The next generation of SON must use **Intent-Driven** logic to balance these competing goals. 

Energy efficiency is not just about turning things off; it is about turning them on only when they add value.
