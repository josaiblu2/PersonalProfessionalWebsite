# Security in an Open World: Protecting the O-RAN Ecosystem

The shift toward **Open RAN** brings incredible innovation, but it also expands the attack surface. In a multi-vendor, disaggregated environment, security cannot be an afterthought—it must be baked into the architecture.

Key pillars of O-RAN security:
• **Interface Protection:** Securing the O1, A1, and E2 interfaces with strong authentication and encryption.
• **App Governance:** Ensuring that rApps and xApps from third-party vendors are sandboxed and only have access to the data they need.
• **Conflict Management:** Preventing malicious or poorly coded apps from taking conflicting actions that could destabilize the network.
• **Continuous Auditing:** Using the SMO to monitor all automated actions for anomalous behavior.

Openness does not mean vulnerability. By using standardized security frameworks and automated governance, an Open RAN can be **more secure** and more transparent than a traditional closed system.

The future of networks is open, but only if it is trusted.
