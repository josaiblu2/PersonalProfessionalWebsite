# Network Slicing Will Fail – Unless We Change The Commercial Model

Network slicing is one of the most powerful capabilities introduced with 5G.
Technically, it is elegant.
Architecturally, it is flexible.
Operationally, it is promising.
Commercially… it is still uncertain.
Many operators proudly announce slicing readiness.

But readiness is not revenue.
Here is the uncomfortable truth:
Network slicing will fail as a monetization strategy if we treat it as a technical feature instead of a commercial product.

Today, slicing conversations often focus on:

•	Latency guarantees.
•	Throughput differentiation.
•	Isolated resources.
•	SLA enforcement.

All important.
But enterprises do not buy latency in milliseconds.
They buy operational certainty.

If slicing is sold as “premium connectivity,” it will compete with existing enterprise plans and eventually become commoditized.
The real challenge is not building slices.
It is packaging, pricing, and positioning them correctly.

Three structural gaps are slowing monetization:

First, Slicing is defined technically, but not vertically.
Different industries require different service constructs. A hospital, a port, and a smart factory do not need the same SLA language.
Second, Commercial models are still bandwidth-based.
Slicing demands outcome-based pricing aligned with business impact.
Third, Internal alignment is fragmented.
Network teams build capability. Sales teams struggle to translate it. Finance cannot model it clearly.
Without a commercial redesign, slicing becomes another over-engineered feature with limited ROI.

To unlock its value, operators must:

•	Define slices as industry-specific service packages, not generic technical profiles.
•	Integrate slicing with edge computing, security, and analytics to create complete solutions.
•	Align SLA language with operational KPIs that matter to enterprise decision-makers.
•	Simplify commercial offers so they are understandable at the board level.

Slicing is not about dividing the network.
It is about dividing value.

And value must be clearly defined, priced, and delivered.

If we keep thinking like network engineers, slicing will remain a technical success and a commercial disappointment.
If we think like solution providers, slicing can become the foundation of differentiated 5G monetization.
The technology is ready.
The question is: is the business model?
