# The Near-RT RIC: Bringing Intelligence to the Edge of the RAN

One of the most exciting shifts in O-RAN is the introduction of the **Near-Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller (Near-RT RIC)**. This component allows us to move optimization logic from the minutes/hours scale (Non-RT) to the **10ms to 1s range**.

This sub-second control loop enables features that were previously impossible with traditional SON:
• **Per-UE Traffic Steering:** Making handover and steering decisions based on individual application needs in real-time.
• **Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS) Optimization:** Fine-tuning resources between 4G and 5G at a granular level.
• **Advanced Interference Management:** Reacting to rapid changes in the radio environment.

The Near-RT RIC hosts **xApps**, which are specialized microservices that can be provided by different software vendors. This modularity is the key to a truly open and innovative RAN.

By bringing intelligence closer to the edge, we are making the network faster, smarter, and more responsive than ever before.
