# Network Automation in 5G Release 17 : From Features to Operating Models

One of the most exciting shifts in O-RAN is the introduction of the **Near-Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller (Near-RT RIC)**. This component For years, network automation in RAN was discussed mainly in terms of features.
A new SON function here, an optimization algorithm there, maybe some AI on top.

5G Release 17 marks a clear shift.
Automation is no longer just a collection of capabilities. It is becoming an operating model.

The difference is subtle, but critical.

In previous releases, automation was often reactive and fragmented. Functions worked in isolation, solving local problems without full awareness of end-to-end impact. Engineers still had to orchestrate most decisions manually.

Release 17 pushes automation one level higher.

Here is what really changes:

• Network automation moves closer to closed-loop operation, where detection, decision, execution, and validation are treated as a continuous process rather than separate tasks.
• SON evolves from parameter tuning into behavior control, focusing on how the network adapts over time instead of single corrective actions.
• Automation becomes policy-driven, allowing operators to define intent, priorities, and constraints instead of hardcoding optimization logic.
• Data consistency and observability gain central importance, because automation quality now depends more on data trust than on algorithm complexity.
• Human roles shift from execution to supervision, where engineers design strategies, guardrails, and KPIs that guide the automated loops.

This is why Release 17 is not about “more automation features”. It is about aligning technology, processes, and roles around automation as a core operational principle.

In practice, this also explains why automation struggles when treated as a plug-and-play add-on. Without clear objectives, stable data, and architectural thinking, even the most advanced automation frameworks fail to scale.

The most successful 5G networks will not be the ones with the most automation functions enabled.

They will be the ones that adopted automation as the default way of operating the RAN.

Release 17 is not the end of the journey.
It is the point where automation stops being optional.
