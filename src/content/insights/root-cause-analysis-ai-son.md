# AI-Driven Root Cause Analysis: Beyond Threshold Alarms

When a KPI drops in a traditional network, engineers are flooded with alarms. The challenge isn't knowing *that* something is wrong; it's knowing *why*. This is where **AI-Driven Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** is transforming operations.

Traditional RCA relies on static thresholds and "if-then" rules. AI-driven RCA uses pattern recognition to:
• **Correlate Events:** Linking a drop in throughput to a specific software update or a neighbor cell's interference spike.
• **Anomaly Detection:** Identifying subtle performance shifts that don't trigger a hard alarm but indicate a growing problem.
• **Predictive Failure:** Spotting the signature of a hardware failure days before it actually happens.

By automating the "discovery" phase of troubleshooting, we allow engineers to move straight to the **resolution**. 

In the SMO/O-RAN era, RCA becomes an **rApp** that constantly learns from the network's history. The goal is a "Self-Healing" network that identifies its own pain points and suggests (or executes) the cure.
