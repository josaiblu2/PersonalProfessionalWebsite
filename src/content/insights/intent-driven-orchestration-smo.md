# Intent-Driven Orchestration: The Evolution of SMO

In traditional networks, we tell the system **how** to do something (e.g., "set this parameter to X"). In modern 5G networks, we move toward **Intent-Driven Orchestration**, where we tell the system **what** we want to achieve.

The **Service Management and Orchestration (SMO)** layer is the home of this intent-driven logic. Instead of managing thousands of individual parameters, operators define "Intents":
• "Ensure 99.9% reliability for this industrial slice."
• "Maximize energy savings without dropping throughput below 50 Mbps."

The SMO, powered by **rApps**, then calculates the necessary changes across the RAN and Core to meet that intent. It continuously monitors the results and adjusts in a closed-loop.

This shift reduces operational complexity and allows engineers to focus on business outcomes rather than manual configuration. The network becomes a self-adjusting organism aligned with the operator's goals.
